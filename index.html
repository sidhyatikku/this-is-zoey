    <h3>Zoey's online activity:</h3>
    <p>
      Spotify is my favorite app, because I am always listening to music… always. I also have to play music at work, so I use it there too. For the rest of my apps, I mostly use them throughout the day when needed, or when I am just bored. I’m always in contact with my family, so it’s no surprise to me that Messages is second place in my list. My social media apps are used when I am bored at home, or while I am cooking. It seems to make time pass faster.

	 <!-- In the quotes below, copy and paste a quote from the person you interviewed.  -->

   <br>
   <br>
	<blockquote>
		“The biggest thing during COVID that I have had to overcome was the process of moving to New York. I lived alone in the beginning, so it was difficult to meet new people or interact. I felt really stuck, both in my small studio apartment and with my daily routine. Now, after a year of living here, I feel more comfortable and settled. I have a group that feels like family here. When I visited home, Atlanta, over break… it felt sort of unfamiliar. That’s when I knew that I felt more comfortable in New York. ” <br> —Zoey Poole (January 2022)

    <h3>A website that surpised Zoey</h3>
    <div class="web_txt">
      Julia Kim Smith’s portfolio site <a href="https://juliakimsmith.com">juliakimsmith.com</a> I like the layout, it's very simple and clean which is what I am drawn to. Everything feels cleanly organized and displayed. I like how the blocks disappear when you hover, I think it adds a cool stylistic element to the website which otherwise appears fairly simple.
